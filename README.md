# ML-Image-Classification-Flask-API
Flask API that can be used to make image predictions in batches of data scheduled overnight.

Please note, in order for these programs to work, all of the files and locations has to be exactly the same as is currently seen.

The files and purposes are as follows:
G1 & G2 are both folders containing 100 test images each. These are used to send to the API in order to obtain predictions.

The folder named 'fashion' contains the ML model that is used to make predictions.

'Model code setup' is the jupyter notebook as well as the data that was used to create the ML model.
